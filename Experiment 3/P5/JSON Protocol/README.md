# JSON as a data protocol

These examples use the JSON data format to send/read data between P5 and Arduino. JSON is used as a standard protocol on the web for data exchange and thus is integrated into P5 by default.  To encode/decode data on the Arduino side it requires an additional library.  These examples use the  arduinojson library.  [www.arduinojson.org](https://arduinojson.org/v5/doc/)

[These examples use the standard P5 Serial Server and P5 serial library](https://github.com/vanevery/p5.serialcontrol/releases)

## Installing arduinojson

In the Arduino IDE go to: Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries
Search arduinojson

**Important** 

Do not install the default version.
From the dropdown - choose version 5.13.3
Click Install 


# INPUT - Sending data from Arduino to P5

Step1: Allocate a buffer in memory , in this case called  messageBuffer
Step2: Create the base JSON object, in this case called  p5Send

```arduino
 DynamicJsonBuffer messageBuffer(200);                   //create the Buffer for the JSON object        
  JsonObject& p5Send = messageBuffer.createObject();     //create a JsonObject variable in that buffer       
```

Step3: Add a named paramter to the JSON object and assign it a value

This uses 2 parameters
s1
s2

```arduino
p5Send["s1"]=buttonValue; 
p5Send["s2"]=anaValue;  
```

To send the json over the serial port we use the built in .printTo(Serial) function that is part of the arduinojson library
We follow the command with a standard Serial.println() command.
This is done to mark the end of the message with a newline \n character

```arduino
  p5Send.printTo(Serial);                                 //print JSON object as a string
  Serial.println();  
```  


To stabilize the send data it MUST be sent at a standard rate.  These examples use a timer to acheive this.


## Reading data in P5 from Arduino

These examples use the standard serial library methods in P5 and simply adds JSON functionality to the receiving function

This uses a receiving funtion called dataReceived
```javascript
serial.on('data',dataReceived);
```

```javascript
function dataReceived()   //this function is called every time data is received
{
  
var rawData = serial.readStringUntil('\r\n'); //read the incoming string until it sees a newline
    console.log(rawData);                   //uncomment this line to see the incoming string in the console     
    if(rawData.length>1)                      //check that there is something in the string
    {                                         
      
      sensor1 = JSON.parse(rawData).s1;       //the parameter value .s1 must match the parameter name created within the arduino file
      sensor2 = JSON.parse(rawData).s2; 
    }
}
```

The majority of this function remains the same regardless of the data. The section of the code that you should customize for your own parameters.

```javascript

sensor1 = JSON.parse(rawData).s1;       
sensor2 = JSON.parse(rawData).s2;
```
.s1 and .s2 are the names of the parameters created on the arduino These parameter names can be anything you want, but they have to match

# Output - Sending data from P5 to Arduino

The method for sending from P5 is very similar to sending from arduino, but because it is a full function language on a PC, thus there are many more tools available.


First we define a JSON object
```javascript
var ardSend = {}; //uses {} to define it as a JSON variable
```

It then uses a function called sendData to package and send the data to arduino
```javascript
function sendData()
{
  
  ardSend.led1 = sendVal1;                      //add the value to the led1 parameter on the json object
  ardSend.led2 = sendVal2;                      //add the value to the led2 parameter on the json object

  var sendString = JSON.stringify(ardSend);     //convert the json to a string  
  console.log(sendString)

  serial.write(sendString);                     //send it over the serial port    
  serial.write('\n');                           //write a new line character

}
```
This example creates 2 parameters

led1
led2

and assigns a value to them.

The actual sending functionality is done via a setInterval command which is native to javascript.  This is essentially a timer that executes a function at a specified rate.  This is done in the setup() function.
```javascript
  //setting the send rate
  setInterval(sendData,50);         //built in javascript function that executes a funtion every XXXX milliseconds
                                    //in this case we use it to execute the sendData function we do this to stabilize the send function 
``` 

## Reading the data into Arduino from P5

We use the same arduinojson library to do this, and simlar to the other direction we use the parameter name to get the value
```arduino
  DynamicJsonBuffer messageBuffer(200);                   //create the Buffer for the JSON object        
  JsonObject& p5Read = messageBuffer.parse(Serial);      //create a JsonObject variable and attach it to incoming Serial messages     
 
  p5Input1 = p5Read["led1"];
  p5Input2 = p5Read["led2"];

  analogWrite(LEDpin1,p5Input1);
  analogWrite(LEDpin2,p5Input2); 
```
